            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p>
                By accessing and using the Breath Air website, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following
                terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before making a purchase or using our services. Breath
                Air offers a variety of premium vaping products, including e-liquids, vape pens, and accessories, which
                are intended for adult smokers seeking alternatives to traditional tobacco use. All products are
                strictly sold to legal-age adults in compliance with applicable laws. You must be at least 18 years old
                (or the legal age for vaping in your country or region) to purchase products from our website. By making
                a purchase or using our services, you confirm that you are of legal age in your jurisdiction. If you are
                underage, you are prohibited from accessing or purchasing from this site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our products are intended solely for use by legal-age adults and are not suitable for minors,
                non-smokers, or individuals with certain health conditions that may be aggravated by vaping. Breath Air
                does not recommend using vaping products if you have no previous history of tobacco or nicotine use. The
                use of our products is at your own risk, and we are not responsible for any adverse health effects that
                may arise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vaping products, including e-liquids, contain nicotine, an addictive substance that can have serious
                health consequences, particularly for pregnant women, individuals with heart disease, or those with
                respiratory conditions. We urge you to consult with a healthcare professional before using vaping
                products, especially if you have any pre-existing health conditions. Breath Air is not responsible for
                any health issues related to the use of its products. Your privacy is important to us. We collect
                personal data, such as your name, address, email, and payment information, to process orders and improve
                our services. We do not share your personal information with third parties, except when necessary to
                complete transactions or as required by law. For more details, please refer to our full privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using our website, you agree not to engage in prohibited activities, including impersonating another
                person or entity, using the site to promote illegal activities, selling or distributing our products to
                minors, and violating any applicable laws or regulations in your jurisdiction. Breath Air reserves the
                right to suspend or terminate access to users who violate these terms.
